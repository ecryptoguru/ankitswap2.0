This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app).

## Ankitswap

Just launched my biggest Full-Stack Dapp yet! Introducing Ankitswap, a fully operational DEX with custom router and custom tokens deployed on Goerli Testnet. The custom-code backend was built using Uniswap Labs V2 core and Uniswap Periphery modules, integrating router, liquidity adder, and ERC-20 token exchange features.
The modern frontend, built using React and Tailwind CSS, includes massive features and took some time to build.
The Dapp is live and anyone can check it out, just make sure to have some weth to do the transactions on Goerli Testnet.
